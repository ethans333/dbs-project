# What's Left To Do

What I need from you guys is
1. Create the triggers for all the tables by modifying the existing tables in php admin. For example if I delete an RSO owning a certain number of events all those events should be deleted. There should be many triggers to implment so I would refer to the ER diagram in order to do that. 

**Note: phpmyadmin has a way to import and export projects. If you look in the folder of this repository titled wamp exorts there should be an export for this project that you can import host in phpmyadmin. The beauty of this is that you can modify the SQL code directly from within that file so I would just modify the tables in that file and then import the file into phpmyadmin.**

2. Once that is done I need you guys to do a ton of front end testing to makesure there isn't any bugs or errors and everything operates as intended.

The bulk of it is done im relying on you all to finish the little of whats remaining. Message me on discord if you have any questions.
